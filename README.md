# ADMIN PAGE DASHBOARD

The dashboard allows users to check the sales performance of products and track the progress of team members. Users also could add new tasks and delete tasks that have been done. Moreover, there is a monthly timeline to remind users big event and the date when big event happens. Users could edit the date and event according to their own schedule.
